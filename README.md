<h1 align="center">Week 2 Project: Rick And Morty Profiles App</h1>
<h2>Project Description: Build and Deploy on Vercel/Netlify an application that displays a list of characters from the Rick and Morty API.</h2>

> In this project, you will implement most of the React features learnt during your week 2 of learning React. You will be building a Rick and Morty profiles app. The app will display a list of characters from the Rick and Morty TV show. You will be able to filter the list of characters by name and also view the details of each character. The app should also include a routing feature that will allow you to navigate between the list of characters and the details of each character.

<h2>Project Requirements</h2>

- Use React and Tailwind to build and design the app.
- Consume the Rick and Morty API to get the list of characters. Endpoint -> <a href="https://github.com/zinduaschool/React-Rick-Morty-Profiles-App.git">Rick And Morty API.</a>
- Your app should implement navigation using React Router dom. The app should have two routes, one for the list of characters and the other for the details of each character.
- The app should have a search bar that allows you to filter the list of characters by name.
- Deploy the app on Vercel or netlify.
- The codes should be neatly formatted and files well structured.

<h3>Bonus Points</h3>

- Implement Login Logout Feature in the App from lessons learnt in the week 2 LMS content. This includes,
  - using the context API to manage your user State
  - CRUD operations on the Characters where a user can delete a character from the list of characters.

<h2>Deliverables</h2>

- A live link to your hosted app on Vercel or Netlify.
- A link to the github repo for your app.
<h2>Design Examples</h2>

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
